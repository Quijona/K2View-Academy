      Note:

      1. The field is prepopulated with *Instance Group name*, which you should change.

      2. The name should start with a letter and should contain only alphanumeric characters and underscore.

## How Do I Invoke an Instance Group from the Batch Command

**Example** 

    BATCH Customer.customer_IG_600To700 FABRIC_COMMAND="sync_instance CUSTOMER.?" with JOB_AFFINITY='10.21.2.102' async='true';

The Instance Group is defined from Fabric Studio - *customer_IG_600To700*

Result:

All instances with ID values between 600 and 700 are synced into Fabric.

```fabric>BATCH Customer.customer_IG_600To700 FABRIC_COMMAND="sync_instance CUSTOMER.?";```

```
