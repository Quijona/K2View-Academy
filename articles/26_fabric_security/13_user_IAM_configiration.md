# User IAM Configuration

Fabric allows you to configure web access and console access according to required authentication methods.

The configuration resides in the Fabric main configuration file - **config.ini**. For more information about this file see [here](/articles/02_fabric_architecture/05_fabric_main_configuration_files.md#configini).

First, look for the config parameters in the locations as described below:

* The **web access** is based on the `WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PROTOCOL` property which gets one of 2 values:
  * "SAML", indicate to Fabric to use SAML as IDP. In this case the `saml` section properties shall be set properly, as described later in this article. 
  * SERVER_AUTHENTICATOR", indicate to Fabric to use the authenticators which are defined at `server_authenticator` section, as described later in this article. 

- The **console access** is based on `server_authenticator` section definitions.



## SAML Configuration

#### Preparations

The integration with a SAML IDP requires that both the identity provider (IDP) and the service provider (SP) i.e. Fabric, will provide information to each other which will then be uploaded and configured in both platforms.

* **Get from the IDP** - to be copied and downloaded from thee IDP Admin user interfaces 

  * IDP entity ID

  * IDP SERVICE URL, the IDP endpoint to which Fabric redirects the user.

  * Certificate file, the public key which is generated by the IDP. To import it into Fabric run the following:

    `keytool -import -alias <IDP-CERT_ALIAS> -file <full-path-to-downloaded-cert-file> -storetype JKS -keystore $K2_HOME/.cassandra_ssl/cassandra.truststore`

    The specified alias name should also be used at the configuration for the *IDP_CERT_ALIAS* property. 

* **Provide the IDP**

  * SP entity ID

  * ACS URL - the endpoint at Fabric to which the SAML response should be sent

  * Certificate file - this is the public key which is generated by the Fabric private key. To generate it, run the following:

    `keytool -export -alias <SP-CERT-ALIAS> -storepass <password> -file <output-filename>.cer -keystore $K2_HOME/.cassandra_ssl/keystore.jks`

    The specified alias name should be used at the configuration for the *SP_CERT_ALIAS* property. 



##### Keystore verification

You can verify the certification keys by using this command: `keytool -list -storepass <passowrd> -keystore <path to the jks repository file>`. JKS (Java KeyStore) is a repository of security certificates – either authorization certificates or public key certificates – as well as corresponding private keys.

While running this command after running the above two keytool's *import* and *export* commands, you will see the corresponding two entries, where you can see, for each entry, its alias, last modified date, its type, and its fingerprint. Below is an example of the command's output using Okta as IDP:

`okta, Apr 28, 2021, trustedCertEntry, Certificate fingerprint (SHA1): 7F:CD:76:A6:B2:47:53:7E:BD:9E:20:44:B0:25:6B:78:A9:E3:25:40`
`k2view, Apr 18, 2021, PrivateKeyEntry, Certificate fingerprint (SHA1): 2C:9B:F3:8E:60:E6:BC:9F:82:84:A6:55:BE:62:2B:87:7D:42:BB:46`



For more information and guides as to where and how this information should be set at IDPs - refer to [Azure AD SAML Setup Guide](/articles/26_fabric_security/14_user_IAM_SAML_Azure_AD_setup.md) and [Okta SAML Setup Guide](/articles/26_fabric_security/15_user_IAM_SAML_Okta_setup.md).



#### Editing the config.ini file

Following are the configuration actions that should be applied in the Fabric **config.ini** configuration file, using the information that was acquired at the preparation step:

- **SP_ENTITYID**, the identity of the Fabric, in URI format, which should be also populated at the IDP. Format: `https://<HOSTNAME>`. 

- **SP_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE_URL**, the endpoint at Fabric to where the identity provider will redirect with its authentication response. Format: `https://<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>/api/authenticate`. The host name should be the Fabric load-balancer hostname. This property is also populated at the IDP side.
- **IDP_ENTITYID**, the entity ID, in URI format, as supplied by the IDP.

- **IDP_SINGLE_SIGN_ON_SERVICE_URL**, the IDP endpoint for SAML request. 

- **SECURE**, flag indicating if certification and encryption is applied. Default is "true".

- **SP_CERT_ALIAS**, alias to the certification that is uploaded to the IDP,which is the public key to sign and encrypt the SAML response 

- **IDP_CERT_ALIAS**, alias to the certification supplied by the IDP, which is the public key to to sign and encrypt the SAML request.



#### Configurations for Windows OS

When Fabric is running on Windows OS, usually when working locally during the project implementation or testing, the following additional steps need to be done, in regards to the certification files.

1. Open the "fabric-server-start.bat" located in the Fabric server scripts directory - "<FABIRC_HOME>\Server\fabric\scripts".
2. Update the following 4 properties
   - set javax_net_ssl_keyStore - the full path of the Fabric key store repository (jks file). This repository stores the the private key based upon which the public key is generated (this key is sent to the IDP).
   - set javax_net_ssl_keyStorePassword
   - set javax_net_ssl_trustStore - the full path of the trust store, where the public key, which retrieved from the IDP, is stored (for local machine you can use same jks file, which holds the keystore).
   - set javax_net_ssl_trustStorePassword
3. Restart Fabric.



## server_authenticator Configuration

`server_authenticator`  property requires which authenticator to be used to be defined,  and when needed,  an additional accompanying section must be added.

There are four authenticators which come as part of the Fabric platform, and are considered as reserved names: "fabric", "block_all", "ldap", "asldap", as following:

- **fabric**, when using Fabric local Cassandra. For this no no further settings are required.
- **block_all** meaning that access is blocked. For this no no further settings are required. 
- **ldap**, connect to LDAP server. For this option the LDAP server connection details are required and should be defined at section name: `ldap_auth`. 

- **adldap**. connect to AD/LDAP server. For this option the AD/LDAP server connection details are required and shall be defined at section name: `adldap_auth`.

The default authenticator is "fabric" when `server_authenticator` is not set.

### LDAP Configuration

The `adldap_auth` or `ldap_auth` sections must define the following:

- **url** - LDAP URL endpoint.
- **security_level**, set to "simple".
- **admin_dn**, the admin user at LDAP that has permissions to search and look for other users.
- **admin_password**, the admin user password.
- **users_base_dn**, the root base "dn" of the users.

The values should be provided by the organization's LDAP group.

Note that if LDAP is used as an authenticator, an admin role is created automatically for Fabric bootstrap. The admin's role name is configurable in the *admin_privileges* configuration file. 

### Proprietary Custom Authenticator

In order to use a custom authenticator do the following at the config.ini:

1. Add the `server_authenticator` authenticator list
2. Add an new accompany section, following this naming convention: `<authenticator_name>_auth`. 
   - Under this section add a parameter named "class_name" where its value is the full class name of the implemented authenticator. Other parameters can be added too and will be passed to the authenticator when activated.

For more information about customer authenticator implementation see [here]().

### Sequence Authenticators

A sequence of authenticators can be specified using a comma separator:  `server_authenticator=<auth_1>[,<auth_2>, <auth_3>...]`.  For example: `server_authenticator=ldap,fabric`. The specified authenticators are evaluated by their order, where each is used as fallback to its predecessor.

Note that appropriate accompanying section must be added per authenticator. For example, if `server_authenticator=ldap,fabric` is configured then one additional section - "ldap_auth" - should be added.

If there is a need to use the same type, for example - use 2 LDAP servers, where one is a fallback to another, then you need to do the following:

1. Give a name to each of them, for example: "ldap1", "ldap2"
2. Make sure the additional section names match their names, for example: "ldap1_auth", "ldap2_auth"
3. Define their class-name as an additional property for the "<name>_auth" section, similar to proprietary custom authenticator. This must be done because these names are not the reserved names. For example, in case of LDAP - `class_name=com.k2view.fabric.authentication.providers.LdapAuthenticator`.
