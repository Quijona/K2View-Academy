# User IAM Configuration

Fabric lets configuring the web access and the console access according to required authentication methods.

The configuration resides in Fabric main configuration file - config.ini file. For more information about this file see [here](/articles/02_fabric_architecture/05_fabric_main_configuration_files.md#configini).

First, look for the config parameters as following:

* The **web access** is based on the `WEB_AUTHENTICATION_PROTOCOL` property which gets one of 2 values:
  * "SAML", indicate to Fabric to use SAML as IDP. In this case the `saml` section properties shall be set properly, as described later in this article. 
  * SERVER_AUTHENTICATOR", indicate to Fabric to use the authenticators which are defined at `server_authenticator` section, as described later in this article. 

- The **console access** is based on `server_authenticator` section definitions.



## SAML Configuration

#### Preparations

The integration with SAML IDP requires that both IDP and SP i.e. Fabric will provide information to each other which will then uploaded and configured in both platforms.

* **Get from the IDP** - to be copied and downloaded from thee IDP Admin UI 

  * IDP entity ID

  * IDP SERVICE URL, the IDP endpoint that Fabric redirect user into.

  * certificate file, the public key which is generated by IDP. To import it into Fabric run the following:

    `keytool -import <IDP-CERT_ALIAS> test1 -file <full-path-to-downloaded-cert-file> -storetype JKS -keystore $K2_HOME/.cassandra_ssl/cassandra.truststore`

    The specified alias name shall be used at the configuration for the *IDP_CERT_ALIAS* property. 

* **Provide to the IDP**

  * SP entity ID

  * ACS URL - the endpoint at Fabric that SAML response shall be sent to

  * certificate file - this is the public key which is generated by Fabric private key. To generate it run the following:

    `keytool -export -alias <SP-CERT-ALIAS> -storepass changeit -file <output-filename>.cer -keystore $K2_HOME/.cassandra_ssl/keystore.jks`

    The specified alias name shall be used at the configuration for the *SP_CERT_ALIAS* property. 



For more information and guides where and how this information shall be set at IDPs - refer to [Azure AD SAML Setup Guide](/articles/26_fabric_security/14_user_IAM_SAML_Azure_AD_setup.md) and [Okta SAML Setup Guide](/articles/26_fabric_security/15_user_IAM_SAML_Okta_setup.md).



#### Editing the config.ini file

Following are the configuration that shall be applied at the Fabric config.ini configuration file, using also the information that acquired at the preparation step:

- **SP_ENTITYID**, the identity of the Fabric, in URI format, which shall be populated at the IDP 

- **SP_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE_URL**, the endpoint at Fabric where the identity provider will redirect to with its authentication response. Format: `https://<host-name>:3213/api/authenticate`. The host name shall be the Fabric load-balancer hostname. This property is also populated at the IDP side.
- **IDP_ENTITYID**, the entity ID, in URI format, as supplied by the IDP.

- **IDP_SINGLE_SIGN_ON_SERVICE_URL**, the IDP endpoint for SAML request. 

- **SECURE**, flag indicating if certification and encryption is applied. Default is "true".

- **SP_CERT_ALIAS**, alias to the certification that is uploaded to the IDP,which is the public key to sign and encrypt the SAML response 

- **IDP_CERT_ALIAS**, alias to the certification that supplied by the IDP, which is the public key to to sign and encrypt the SAML request.



## server_authenticator Configuration

`server_authenticator`  property requires to define which authenticator to be used and when needed an additional accompany section.

There are four authenticators which come as part of the Fabric platform, and are considered as reserved names: "fabric", "block_all", "ldap", "asldap", as following:

- **fabric**, when using Fabirc local Cassandra. For this no no further settings is required.
- **block_all** meaning that access is blocked. For this no no further settings is required. 
- **ldap**, connect to LDAP server. For this option the LDAP server connection details are required and shall be defined at section name: `ldap_auth`. 

- **adldap**. connect to AD/LDAP server. For this option the AD/LDAP server connection details are required and shall be defined at section name: `adldap_auth`.

The default authenticator is "fabric" when `server_authenticator` is not set.

### LDAP Configuration

The `adldap_auth` or `ldap_auth` sections shall define the following:

- **url** - LDAP URL endpoint.
- **security_level**, default is "simple".
- **admin_dn**, the admin user at LDAP that has permissions to search and look other users.
- **admin_password**, the admin user password.
- **users_base_dn**, the root base "dn" of the users.

The values shall be provided by the organization LDAP group.

### Proprietary Custom Authenticator

In order to use a custom authenticator do the following at the config.ini:

1. add it to the `server_authenticator` authenticator list
2. add an new accompany section, following this naming convention: `<authenticator_name>_auth`. 
3. under this section add parameter named "class_name" where its value is the full class name of the implemented authenticator. Other parameters can be added too and will be passed to the authenticator when activated.

For more information about customer authenticator implementation see [here]().

### Sequence Authenticators

A sequence of authenticators can be specified them using comma separator:  `server_authenticator=<auth_1>[,<auth_2>, <auth_3>...]`.  For example: `server_authenticator=ldap,fabric`. The specified authenticators are evaluated by their order, where each is used as fallback to its predecessor.

Note that appropriate accompany section shall be added per authenticator. For example, if `server_authenticator=ldap,fabric` is configured then one additional section - "ldap_auth" - shall be added.

If there is need to use same type, for example - use 2 LDAP servers, where one is a fallback to another, then you shall:

1. Give a name to each of them, for example: "ldap1", "ldap2"
2. The additional section names shall match their names, for example: "ldap1_auth", "ldap2_auth"
3. Because these names are not out the reserved names, their class-name shall be defined as additional property for the "<name>_auth" section, similar to proprietary custom authenticator. For example, in case of LDAP - `class_name=com.k2view.fabric.authentication.providers.LdapAuthenticator`.
