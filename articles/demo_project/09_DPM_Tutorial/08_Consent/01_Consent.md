# Consent Management

K2View DPM Consent Management covers the end-to-end lifecycle of managing customer consents, including consent configuration, customer consent preferences, central consent repository, integration with third parties, and more.

The DPM provides the means for the administrator to define any number of consent topics and classify them under consent categories, allowing each organization to define the granularity of the consents it collects.

As legal requirements and services change over time, the administrator can add, edit, or remove consent topics at any time.
This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical Consent Management lifecycle. A lifecycle begins with an Admin setting up consent configurations and integration with third parties.  It completes itself with a customer selecting consent preferences that were set up by the Admin.
