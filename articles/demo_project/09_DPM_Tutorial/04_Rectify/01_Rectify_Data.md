# Data Rectification

This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical data rectification lifecycle. This lifecycle begins with a Customer using DPM to submit a request to update their data within all source systems. It completes itself with a confirmation sent to the customer that the data was updated in the source systems.

Data rectification request lets the Customer update or correct their information in the source systems at a detailed level. The information that the Customer can update depends on source systems and any options you designate for the Customer as modifiable data. After submitting their Request, the Customer receives an email notification of the change completion. 

In our explanations, we will demonstrate the functionality using a Customer we created named Anabelle Deleon. We will assume that this Customer wants to update the city and phone number data the company holds for her. 

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

We will now show you how to submit a request to rectify Anabelle's data.



## Data Rectification Tutorial

The following simulation of working within DPM Requests will show you how to preview data the Customer intends to rectify in the demonstration source systems. After previewing the data, you will log in to DPM, submit a Request for data rectification, ensure the Request is marked Complete, and return to the demonstration source systems to review the rectified data.
