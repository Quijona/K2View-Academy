# Purging Data

This demonstration will guide you through the process of a typical data purge lifecycle. A lifecycle begins with a Customer request to delete their data at all source systems. It completes itself with the Customer verifying that the data was purged from the source.

For this tutorial, we will assume that a Customer named Aleena Conley wants to delete the data the company holds about her. You can search for this Customer and view her data by accessing our two "source systems".

[Access Source Systems](../00_Setup/00_Access_Source_Systems.md) provides details on the access to the tutorial "source systems".

We will now show you how to submit a request to delete Aleena's data.

The following simulation of working within DPM Requests will show you how to log in to DPM as a Representative, submit a Request on the customer's behalf, ensure your Request was marked Complete, and view your purged data in the demo "Source Systems".
