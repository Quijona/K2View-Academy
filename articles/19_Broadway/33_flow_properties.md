# Flow Properties

The Flow Properties window enables viewing and editing the flow's description and tags. Each flow can have zero, one or multiple tags, as tagging a flow is optional. Setting the flow description is optional as well. 

When the flow is created under a category (folder), the category name is set as a default tag.

To view and edit the flow's description and tags, take the following steps:

1. Click **Actions** > **Flow Properties** in the [Main menu](18_broadway_flow_window.md#main-menu) toolbar to open the Flow Properties window. 
    * All existing tags are presented in the Tags list. 
    * The flow's tags are marked. 
2. To add a new tag, write the tag name in the 'New Tag' area and click the <img src="images/plus.png" style="zoom:65%;" /> icon. 
3. To remove the existing tag, unmark it in the list.
4. To update the description, populate the Description area.
5. Click **Submit**.

Note that the tags and the description are only saved upon the saving the flow.
