# Flow Properties

Flow Properties window enables viewing and editing flow's description and tags. 

When opening the window, all existing tags are presented in the list and the flow's tags are marked. 

* To add a new tag, right the tag name in the 'New Tag' area and click <img src="images/plus.png" style="zoom:80%;" />icon. 
* To remove the existing tag, unmark it in the list. 

Each flow can have zero, one or multiple tags, as tagging a flow is optional. Setting the flow description is optional as well. 

When the flow is created under a category (folder), the category name is set as the default tag.
