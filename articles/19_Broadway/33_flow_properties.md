* To add a new tag, write the tag name in the 'New Tag' area and click <img src="images/plus.png" style="zoom:60%;" /> icon. 
* To remove the existing tag, unmark it in the list. 

Each flow can have zero, one or multiple tags, as tagging a flow is optional. Setting the flow description is optional as well. 

When the flow is created under a category (folder), the category name is set as the default tag.
