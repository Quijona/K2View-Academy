# Support Parallel Execution

Broadway enables running several Actors of the same Stage parallelly.

To define parallel execution, click ![image](images/99_19_dots.PNG) in the right corner of the Stage to open the [Stage context menu](18_broadway_flow_window.md#stage-context-menu) and select **Parallel** to populate the number of parallel threads. Once submitted, <img src="images/99_19_parallel_01.PNG" alt="Parallel" /> icon and the number of parallel threads is displayed above the Stage name.

To remove parallel execution, click ![image](images/99_19_dots.PNG) > **Parallel** and set the number to zero. 

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Example 1 - Read from LUI and Write into Target DB**

The following example displays a flow with two Inner Flows in Stage 2 that are executed parallelly. Each inner flow in Stage 2 reads data from the LUI and then writes it into the target DB.

**Example 2 - Read and Update LUI**

The following example displays a flow which synchronizes an LUI into Fabric and then reads from two different LU tables and writes into two different LU tables parallelly.

**Example 3 - Invalid Usage of Parallel Execution**

The following example of performing two GET Instance commands parallelly is invalid. The attempt to execute the flow causes an exception.
