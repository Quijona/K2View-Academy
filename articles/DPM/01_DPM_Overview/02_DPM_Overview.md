# K2View DPM Overview

The Data Privacy Management Tool provides an efficient and effective means to administer data privacy regulations such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Brazil’s General Data Protection law (LGPD), and others.

K2View’s DPM tool embodies a flexible system to allow a company to define the types of data requests for the regulations affecting the company’s use of customer data, the processes and flows for how data is tasked to completion to fulfill regulations compliant to one or more data privacy regulators.

### K2View’s DPM is comprised of two main modules:

**Admin module**: The Admin module is used by the DPM Administrator for the configuration of the tool. The Administrator defines all DPM aspects; such as the supported regulations, the types of requests allowed for each regulation, the task flow required to fulfill each request, customer consent configuration, and more.

**Data subject requests and consent management:** Role-based components that serve different users, such as:

- Call Center Representatives - responsible for submission of data requests
- Data Stewards - responsible for fulfillment of data requests
- Case Owners - responsible for successful completion of the requests administered.
- Supervisors - administer allocation of Data Requests to Case Owners

The preceding user-based components cover the end-to-end life cycle of data privacy-related requests including:

- Submission of a new request
- Request fulfilment process
- SLA management
- Management dashboards, and
- Generation of audit data
