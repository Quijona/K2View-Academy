# DPM Overview

<a href="https://www.k2view.com/products/data-privacy-management" target="_blank">The Data Privacy Management Tool</a> provides an efficient and effective means to administer requirements of the various data privacy regulations, such as <a href="https://www.k2view.com/solutions/gdpr-and-ccpa-compliance/" target="_blank">the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and Brazil’s General Data Protection law (LGPD)</a>.

K2View’s DPM tool provides a flexible system that allows a company to define data request types for the regulations affecting the company’s use of customer data, the processes, and flows for how data is tasked to completion to fulfill regulations compliant to one or more data privacy regulators.

## K2View’s DPM is comprised of two main modules:

**Admin module**: The Admin module is used by the DPM Administrator for the tool configuration. The Administrator defines all DPM aspects, such as the supported regulations, the types of requests allowed for each regulation, the task flow required to fulfill each request, and customer consent configuration.

**Data subject requests and consent management:** Role-based components that serve different users, including:

- Call Center Representatives - responsible for submitting data requests
- Data Stewards - responsible for fulfilling data requests
- Case Owners - responsible for successful completion of the requests administered
- Supervisors - responsible for administering allocation of Data Requests to Case Owners
- DPOs - Provide information to Data Privacy Officers who oversees the privacy regulations compliance

The preceding role-based components cover the end-to-end life cycle of data privacy-related requests, including:

- Submission of a new request
- Request fulfillment process
- SLA management
- Consent preferences
- Management dashboards
- Generation of audit data
