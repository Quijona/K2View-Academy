# Supervisor Case Owner Allocation Configuration 

A supervisor is responsible for the configuration of how new DPM requests are allocated to the users that make part of the Case Owners team: Whenever a new Request is submitted, the system will automatically select one of the users that are defined as Case Owners, and will allocate the new Request to this user. The resource management screen is where the Supervisor can configure the method that the system uses in order to select one of the users
The supervisor accesses the screen of assignment method configuration by using the   ![image](images/Figure_50_a_resource_management_icon.png) menu option.

There are two categories of configuration:

- Assignment method – defines how to allocate a new Request if there is more than one Case Owner that could take this ownership. 

- Assignment criteria – refinement of the assignment method, allowing the supervisor the indicate specific Case Owners as responsible for cases of a specific Regulation or Activities under a specific regulation.
