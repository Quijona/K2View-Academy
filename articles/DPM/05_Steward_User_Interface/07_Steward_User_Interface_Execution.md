## Executing a Task

A Task can be executed by any of the Stewards sharing the same Corporate Role. 
In order to perform a Task, the Steward should first pick up the Task from the pending task list and assign it to himself by clicking the  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_44_get_icon.png) button, that is located at the end of this Tasks row in the table.

As a result, the Task Details screen is opened for this Task, and this is where the Steward can perform the actions needed to complete the Task, as explained in the next chapter.

An alternative way for the user to “Get” a Task is by clicking the row of this Task from the list, which opens the Task Details screen (described next). This screen also includes the “Get” buttons and the user can assign the Task to himself directly in this screen.
