# Task Execution

A Task can be executed by any of the Stewards sharing the same Corporate Role.  
To perform a Task, the Steward selects the Task from the pending task list and takes assignment by selecting the  ![image](/articles/DPM/images/Figure_44_get_icon.png) button, located at the right side of the row for the selected Task.

As a result, the Task Details screen is opened for this Task, and this is where the Steward can perform the actions needed to complete the Task, as explained in the next chapter.

Next, the Task Details screen is displayed. The Steward performs the necessary actions to complete the Task, as explained in a following section. 
Another option the Steward has to retrieve a task is to click the row of the Task to open the Task Details screen (described next). This screen also includes the “Get” button used to assign this task to the user.
