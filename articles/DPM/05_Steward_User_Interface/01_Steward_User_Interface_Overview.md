# Steward User Interface Overview

A Steward in the DPM system is a user that is responsible to handle the execution of specific Tasks as part of the fulfillment process. Stewards are assigned a specific Corporate Role, which determines what type of Tasks they will perform.

At a high level, the system determines which Task to execute by which Steward, based on the Corporate Role selected when a Task is configured and the Corporate Role of the Steward: each Steward is assigned to a Corporate Role. Additionally, each Task, in the definition of a Flow, has a Corporate Role defined. When a new DPM Request is created, and the Request fulfillment process includes a Task that should be handled by a Steward, this Task appears to the Stewards assigned to the matching role. 

A user that has Steward privileges will see the following menu options upon login:

- Dashboard


- Task List
