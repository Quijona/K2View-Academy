At the top of the screen, filters allow the user to search tasks that answer specific criteria.
The filters are:

- Regulation – Filter according to a specific Regulation.
- Activity Name – Filter according to a specific Activity. This filter can be used only if a Regulation was selected in the Regulation filter; the dropdown list presents the Activity list according to the Activities of the selected regulation .
- Task Status – Filter by the Task status, for example – Completed or In progress.
- Role – The name of the Corporate Role that should perform the Tasks.
- Assignment – This filter allows the Stewards to view the list of Tasks only assigned to them, or view Tasks assigned to other stewards of the same role, or unassigned. 
- Request ID – Used to search for a specific request ID. 

Once the Tasks List is presented, the Steward can perform the following actions on the task:

- Get – This action assigns the task to the steward. The “Get” action is enabled only if the Task is not yet assigned to any user.
- Release – If a Task is assigned to a Steward, they can release it using this button. The Task then returns to the Unassigned status.

- Open the Task Details screen - The Steward selects the desired Task line.
