## Tasks List

The Tasks List screen presents the Tasks that are allocated to the Corporate Role of the specific Steward.

At the top of the screen, filters allow the user to search tasks that answer specific criteria.
The filters are:

- Regulation – filter according to a specific Regulation
- Activity Name – filter according to a specific Activity. This filter can be used only if a Regulation was selected in the Regulation filter, and the dropdown list presents the Activity list according to the Activities of the selected regulation.
- Task Status – filter by the Task status, for example – Completed or In progress.
- Role – the name of the Corporate Role that should perform the Tasks.
- Assignment – this filter allows the Steward to view in the list only the Task assigned to him, or to view Tasks assigned to other stewards of the same role, or Tasks that are not yet assigned. 
- Request ID – used in order to search for a specific request ID. 

Once the Tasks List is presented, the Steward can perform the following actions on the task:

- Get – this action assigns the task to the steward. The “Get” action is enabled only if the Task is not yet assigned to any user.
- Release – If a Task is assigned to a Steward, he can release it using this button. The Task then returns to the Unassigned status.

- Open the Task Details screen, by clicking on the Task line itself.
