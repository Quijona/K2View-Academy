Stages that were already completed are presented in green. The current Stage is presented in blue if it is on track, and red if it is past due. Future Stages appear in grey. 

The number of Tasks in the Stage is presented on top of every stage. If a Stage includes a Task that is overdue, then the Tasks count is presented in red.

The Case Owner can navigate between the stages by clicking on the Stage section in this chart. Navigating to one of the stages will present only the tasks that make part of the selected Stage. The view of all Tasks can be restored by clicking the “Show Tasks for All Stages” button. 

At the bottom of the screen, the list of Tasks is presented:
