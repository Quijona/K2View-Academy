Completed Stages are shown in green. The current Stage is presented in blue when on track towards completion. When the Stage is not on track, it is shown in red signifying past due. Future Stages to be processed appear in grey. 

The number of Tasks in the Stage is displayed on top of every stage. If a Stage includes an overdue Task, then the Tasks count is shown in red.

The Case Owner can navigate between the stages by clicking on the Stage section in the presented chart. Navigating to a particular stage presents only those tasks made a part of the Stage. The view of all Tasks can be restored by selecting the “Show Tasks for All Stages” button. 

At the bottom of the screen, the list of Tasks is presented:
