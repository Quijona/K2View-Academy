The Request list can be filtered based on: 

- Regulation – Filter to present only Requests of a specific Regulation
- Activity - Filter to present only Requests of a specific Activity.
- Status - Filter by Request status.
- Request Risk – This filter enables the user to present only requests which are under risk of missing the overall request SLA.
- Request ID – search for a specific Request. 

The Request List table presents the following information:
