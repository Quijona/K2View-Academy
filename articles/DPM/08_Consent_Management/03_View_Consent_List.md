The Consent Management screen presents the consent topics that were already configured by the Administrator, and allows adding a new consent or altering existing consent configuration:

At the top of the screen, filters allow the user to filter the list of consents that is presented by Regulation and/or by Category.

To search a specific consent, use the “Search” option at the top-right corner of the table. 

For each consent, this table provides the following information:

#### Consent Categories

For the sake of better organization, consents are grouped under user-defined Categories. Categories are defined by the Administrator at the moment of creating a new consent, as described at the section about creating a new consent. The category name can be altered by clicking the “Edit” button at the category line at the consent list table.
