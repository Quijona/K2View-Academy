# Consent Management Overview

K2View Data Privacy Management module (DPM) covers the end-to-end lifecycle of Consent management, including consent configuration, Customer consent preferences management, Central Consent repository, integration with third parties and more.

Its main features include:

**Configurable Consent Topics**
DPM is fully configurable, so that any consent topic can be defined by the DPM administrator using a user-friendly web-based user interface. 

**Obtain Customerâ€™s consent and preferences**
Provide a list of consents relevant to the customer. It allows your customers to review, accept or withdraw consents using a self-service web-based application. Customer preference changes are recorded for audit purposes. 

**Maintain central consents repository**
DPM is the central repository for recording customer consent data across corporate systems. It obtains data from and provides data to any other application.

**Inform** 
Provide a list of Consents processed by a customer and their attributes. Provide an historical view of customer consent actions. The data can be exposed to authorized users or applications via APIs, files, publish/subscribe technologies such as Kafka and more.

**Evidence**
Comply with audit requirements by keeping evidence of who consented, to what, when and via what channel.
