# Consent Management Overview

The K2View Data Privacy Management module (DPM) covers the end-to-end lifecycle of Consent Management, including consent configuration, customer consent preferences, central consent repository, integration with third parties, and more.

The following list describes the main features of Consent Management.

**Configurable Consent Topics**
DPM is fully configurable, and any consent topic can be defined by the DPM Administrator through a user-friendly, Web-based user interface. 

**Obtain Customerâ€™s consent and preferences**
Provide a list of consents relevant to the customer. This allows your customers to review, accept, or withdraw consents using a self-service, Web-based application. Customer preference changes are recorded for audit purposes. 

**Maintain central consents repository**
DPM is the central repository for recording customer consent data across corporate systems. It obtains data from and provides data to any other application.

**Inform** 
Provide a list of consents processed by a customer and their attributes. Provide an historical view of customer consent actions. The data can be exposed to authorized users or applications via APIs, files, publish/subscribe technologies (ex: Kafka), and more.

**Evidence**
Comply with audit requirements by keeping evidence of who consented, to what, when, and via what channel.

This chapter provides details about the way consents are configured and managed using K2View DPM.
