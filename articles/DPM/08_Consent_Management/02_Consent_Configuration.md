## Consent Topics and Categories Configuration

K2View Consent Management is a flexible, configurable system, which allows each organization to determine which are the consents topics that should be managed by the system. 
The administrator can define any number of Consent Topics and classify them under Consent Categories, allowing each organization to define the granularity of the consents it collects. 
As legal requirements and services change over time, the administrator can add, edit or remove consent topics at any point.
