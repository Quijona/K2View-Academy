## Consent Data Repository, Historical Data and Audit Information

The customer consent preferences are stored in the K2View DPM central Consent Management data repository. This data includes both current customer preferences and the user’s change history. The data is used in customer user interfaces, provides information to other applications, and enables historical tracking. The Consent Management data repository also provides detailed information for auditing, research, and reporting purposes.  

The information stored for each consent preference and its respective change includes the following details.

- The user identification.
- The date and time the change was performed.
- The consent topic that was changed (example: consent to participating in a marketing campaign.)
- The user response to the consent topic (example: opt-in or opt-out.)

When a user accesses the Consent Management Web page, the current consent preference and history of changes are available for the user’s review. The information presented to the user is obtained by calling a built-in Consent Management API. This same API can be integrated with the company’s mobile app, and that the same data is presented in both the app and the Web portal.
