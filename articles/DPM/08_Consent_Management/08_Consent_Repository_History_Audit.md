## Consent Data Repository, Historical Data and Audit Information

The customers consent preferences are stored at K2View DPM central Consent Management data repository. This includes the current customer preferences as well as the history of any change that was performed by the users. This information is used in customer user interfaces, as well as to provide information to other applications and to enable historical tracking. Another use of the consent data repository is to provide detailed information for auditing, research and reporting purposes.  

The information that is stored for each consent preference and for each preference change includes details such as: 

- The user identification 
- The date and time that the change was performed
- The consent topic that was changed (for example – consent to be a target of marketing campaign)
- The response that the user gave for this consent topic: opt-in or opt-out. 

When a user accesses the consent management web page, the current consent preference and history of changes are available for the user’s review. The information that is presented to the user is obtained by calling a built-in Consent management API. This same API can be used in the integration with the company’s mobile App, so that the same data is presented in both the app and the web portal.
