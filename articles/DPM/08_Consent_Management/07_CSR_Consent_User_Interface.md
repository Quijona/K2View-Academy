## Customer Service Representative (CSR) Consent User Interface

The interfaces provided by DPM for the use of representatives and agents is similar to the screens and APIs provided for the customer that was described in the previous chapter. DPM includes both a web-based user interface and an API set in order to allow a customer service representative (CSR) or an agent to perform the same consent management activities as the customer. This includes viewing the consent preferences of an end-user as well as submitting a change to the consent preferences on behalf of the end-user.

The consent preferences can be set by the representative on behalf of a customer by accessing the Consent Management menu option at the Representative menu:

When accessing this menu option, the representative can review the list of consents for a specific customer, opt-in or opt-out to each of them on behalf of this customer or view historical information about opting-in or opting-out activities previously performed for this customer.

The Consent Management functionality at representative level is equal to this functionality at customer level, the only difference being that the representative should select the customer identification in order to retrieve the information.

 As depicted in the figure above, the representative should type the customer identification at the upper-left corner of the screen and retrieve the information for the customer by clicking the “search” button. For more details about the information and activities that can be done in this screen, see the previous entry of Customer Consent Management.
