When accessing this menu option, the customer can review the list of consents, define if to opt-in or opt-out to each of them, or view historical information about opting-in or opting-out activities previously performed.

### Consent History

Any change that the customer performed on the consent preferences (opt-in/opt-out) is registered at the system for audit purposes, and is presented to the customer at the Consent History tab:
