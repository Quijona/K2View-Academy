# Customer Facing Interfaces For Consent

DPM offers multiple options to collect and manage customer consents: 

- DPM Web-based end-user interface: K2View’s DPM includes a built-in, Web-based user interface that allows each customer to review the list of consents and update the preferences for each of the consent categories. 
- Integration with the customer self-service Web page and App: The information that is managed within K2View’s DPM is also exposed via access-controlled REST APIs. These APIs provide the ability to integrate the consent data as part of your organization’s web portal, mobile app, CRM, or any other user interface. 

DPM’s user interface presents to the end-user a clear and simple view of the consents which the user can concede to or withdraw from. Changing the preferences between opt-in and opt-out of each consent topic is done with one click. The user is then presented with a confirmation message that includes the text clarifying the advantages of opting-in or the impacts of opting-out.
