# Activities 

## Activity Details

When one of the lines in the Activities table is selected, or, by using the “Edit” icon, the system displays the “Edit Activity” pop-up screen.

From this screen, the user can:

- Change the name of the Activity.
- Change the flow used to fulfill the request. This is accomplished by selecting one of the finalized flows from the drop-down list of available flows 
- Add a new flow by selecting this button. The  “Create a new flow” screen is displayed.  
- Update the flow version. If the option “latest” is selected, then each time a new version of the selected flow is marked as “finalized,” the Activity is automatically updated to use this latest flow.
- Update the Activity SLA, in hours. 

Any update performed on the Activity impacts only requests from the update moment forward. Requests that were already submitted will maintain the previous parameters.  

## Add an Activity

In order to add a new Activity to a Regulation, select the Regulation from the Regulation screen, then click the “Add an Activity” button on the “Regulation Activities” screen. 
The pop-up screen presented is the same as the one used for “Edit an Activity.”
