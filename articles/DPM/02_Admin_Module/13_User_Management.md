## Managing Users in the Admin Module

User access to perform Activities in the DPM is predicated upon the definition of the user to the DPM system with an assigned Corporate Role.  
The authorized user selects User Management menu option under the Admin menu to manage users and privileges for the DPM system.

The list of existing users is displayed. For each user, the user ID, username and email are shown. In the Corporate Role column, the list of Corporate Roles assigned to this user is displayed. Each user can have multiple Corporate Roles, and the functionality assigned to the user reflects the sum of all options enabled under each assigned role. 

### Create a new user
