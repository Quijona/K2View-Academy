# DPM Roles

## Overview

As a role-based application, DPM Roles define the functions within the system enabled for each user as described next.

•	**Admin users**: Admin users are responsible to configure the flows to be executed for each Data Subject Request. An Admin user can perform all the Activities within the Admin module, such as:
-	Define the Regulation and included Activities.
-	Create or update flows, including their stages and tasks.
-	Manage and assign Corporate roles to users.
-	Map Corporate roles to DPM functions.

•	**Customer Service Representative (CSR)**: a CSR is a call center representative attending customer requests by submitting a Data Privacy related request on their behalf. A CSR can:
-	Submit a new request.
-	Inspect the details of an existing request, without changing its details. 

•	 **Data Steward**: data stewards are users assigned to the Request fulfilment process, and are responsible to execute a specific task in the request flow. The Data Steward can:
-	View the list of open tasks that should be handled by the group of representative stewards.
-	Take ownership of a task by marking it as "assigned" to avoid other stewards from working on the same task.
-	Review, Update, or approve a task in order to move it to the next step
-	Release the completed assigned task by this data steward.

•	**Case Owner**:
-	Each customer request submitted in the DPM is assigned to a specific case owner. The case owner follows up on the request progress and assures the request is completed within the expected SLA. A case owner can:
-	View the list of requests, and filter requests, to identify risks of an incomplete request within the stated timeline of the SLA.        
-	Open a specific request and view or complete its stages, tasks. 

•	**Supervisor**: The supervisor is responsible to manage the allocation of requests to the case owners. The supervisor can:
-	Access the dashboard to see the summary view for all requests. 
-	Define the criteria for the allocation of requests to Case owners.  

•	**Customer**: Data Subject Requests can be submitted directly by a customer. A customer can:
-	Create a new request
-	Search for their assigned requests 
-	Check the status of their requests
-	Review the data provided as an output of a completed request


The DPM roles are predefined in the system. Each role includes a designated set of screens and actions relevant for the representative role. DPM roles are used by the Administrator to grant a specific corporate group the ability to view or execute actions in the DPM system. The way those roles are used is explained in the next section "Corporate Roles."
