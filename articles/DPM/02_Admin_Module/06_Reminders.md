## Reminders Tab

Reminders are used in order to preemptively call attention to Tasks that might not be progressing at the expected pace. 
In the Reminders tab, the user can define one or more reminders that should be sent after a predetermined time.

Reminders are always sent to the current email of the user or Role. This means that if the email of a user or Role is changed, reminders generated by the DPM system from that point on will be sent to the new email address.
The email addresses used by the Reminders can be configured by the Administrator in the Role Management and User Management screens.

In addition to the reminders that are configured in this tab, the system also has an automatic reminder that is sent if the Task reaches its deadline and has not  completed. This automatic Reminder email is sent to the email address of the “Task Owner” (configured in the “Task” tab). As this is an automatic email, there is no need to configure a Reminder explicitly for this purpose.
