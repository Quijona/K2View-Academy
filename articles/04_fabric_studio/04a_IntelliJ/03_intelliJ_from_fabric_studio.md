As you can see in the picture above, all Fabric-related Java files and resources for your project will be accessible from the left-hand project tree panel.
In cases where both Fabric Studio Java Editor and IntelliJ IDE are opened on your machine, any manual code update in either environment will be instanteneously reflected in the other.

In addition, all the libraries and dependencies featured in your project will also be exposed in the project tree.
