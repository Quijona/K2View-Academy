# Coding with IntelliJ

## Overview
Fabric platform is built on Java and as such provides the opportunity to enhance your projects with Java functions you might want to write from scratch or with Java
Community 3rd party libraries.   
To ensure best-of-class performance and experience, Fabric has been tightly integrated with the IntelliJ IDEA platform. 
It is recommended to install IntelliJ IDE in cases where your project heavily relies on Java functions, such as for example:
- when creating a [project function]( https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/1fe6c770955eadb87cc80fd9a39af4433382d231/articles/07_table_population/10_creating_a_project_function.md#creating-a-project-function)
- when [enriching or transforming your data]( https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.5/articles/10_enrichment_function/04_enrichment_function_code_examples.md). 
- when exposing your data via Java [Web Services]( https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.5/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/06_web_services_code_examples.md#example-of-a-complex-tdm-web-service).
