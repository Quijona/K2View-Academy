# Project Custom APIs

While the built-in out-of-the-box web services are very useful and comprehensive, Fabric provides a very proudful capability of creating custom web services. This enables building new webservices, according to the project needs, deploy them and immediately use them, without the need to wait for a new product release. This expedites project's go to market and ongoing updates.

Fabric supports two types of method to build and expose the customized web services: 

* Using Graphit - a unique UI utility which can be used to design web services in a user-friendly interface and requires minimal coding.
* Defining a Java Web Service function. 



Using these methods you can easily build your web services and exposes them as REST API. Similar to the built-in web services, the custom web services outcome are JSON, XML or CSV formats. 

Fabric also provides utilities and helpers to ease the building of the web service logic and the output 

In addition, Fabric lets you, easily, via a UI properties pane to:

* Have web services versioning.
* control to strict the outcome format among the 3 formats.
* control and set web services verb 
* control and strict web services permissions 
* control the web services path



The custom web services are also exposed in a similar pattern to the built-in web services: `/api/[VERSION_NO]/<web-service name>[?<parameters>&format=<FORMAT>]`.
