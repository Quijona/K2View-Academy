# Web Services Overview 

Fabric supports three types of Web Services:

* Project's out-of-the-box built-in Web Services for querying and manipulating Logical Units, and Common tables. 
* Custom Web Services, which are developed as part of project's implementation, according to dedicated project needs.
* Product Web Services.

Fabric Web Services apply and follow REST API guidelines and standards.

Fabric provides an Open API testing utility (based on Swagger) as part of the Web Framework applications, where implementor can test web services of any type listed above.
