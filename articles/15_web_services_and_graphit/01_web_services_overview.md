# Web Services Overview 

Fabric supports 2 types of Web Services:

* Product built-in Web Services, which is divided into:
  * Project's out-of-the-box Web Services for querying and manipulating Logical Units, and Common tables. 
  * Base Web Services.

* Custom-Built Web Services, that are developed as part of the project's implementation, according to dedicated project needs.



Fabric Web Services apply and follow REST API guidelines and standards.

Fabric provides an Open API testing utility (based on Swagger) as part of the Web Framework applications, where an implementor can test web services of any type listed above.
