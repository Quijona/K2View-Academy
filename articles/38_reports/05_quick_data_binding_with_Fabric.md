# Quick Data Binding With Fabric

The article [Data Binding](03_data_binding.md) describes all the steps needed to configure a data source and a data set in a report. In addition, there is a quick way to configure the data binding with Fabric built-in endpoints. The following steps describe how to do it:

1. Right-click on **Reports > New Report** and populate the report name to create a new report.

2. Click on <img src="images/db_interface_icon.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> icon on the Studio Toolbox to switch to the DB Interface tree.

3. Drill down to the required interface and a table on which you'd like to create a report, do right click and select **Add Data Set**.

4. As a result, the data source, data set and a parameter are automatically created:

5. Note that you still must validate the data set. Open the newly created data set and click Validate. [Click for more information regarding Data Set validation.](03_data_binding.md#data-set-validation)
