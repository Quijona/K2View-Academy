# Reports Overview

Starting with V7.1, Fabric includes a **Reports** application, which enables building interactive pixel-perfect reports. This application supports data binding to a wide variety of JSON data sources, by providing a flexible connection configuration to a REST API endpoint.

Fabric's **Reports** is a lightweight reporting solution, implemented using the 3rd party application - *ActiveReportsJS* - which is embedded into the [K2View Web Framework](/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.md). The *ActiveReportsJS* license is included within Fabric license. No separate installation or configuration is required. 

Fabric's **Reports** application includes the Designer and Viewer components:

* **Designer** - enables creating the report template, including the following: 
  - Definition of data sources, data sets and parameters.
  - Binding the report's elements to the data set's fields.
  - Creating the report's layout design (fonts, colors, etc). 
* **Viewer** - enables generating the report, including the following:
  - Generating the report's preview. 
  - Searching for data within the preview file.
  - Downloading the extract files. The supported formats are: PDF, HTML and CSV.

Access to Designer is available via Fabric Studio as the reports' creation is performed during the project development stage. Access to Viewer is available via the Web Framework application's list.

The reports can be generated by one of the following ways: 

* By generating the report's preview in the Viewer module.
* Using deep link in browser.

Follow this user guide to learn more about each step of the reports setup, implementation and generation.
