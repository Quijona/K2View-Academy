# Reports Overview

Starting with V7.1, Fabric includes a **Reports** application which enables building interactive pixel-perfect reports. The application supports data binding to a wide variety of JSON data sources by providing flexible connection configuration at design time and rich API for advanced use-cases.

Fabric Reports is implemented using *ActiveReportsJS by GrapeCity*, and is included in Fabric's license and Fabric installation package. No separate installation or configuration is required. All the Fabric Reports components operate in a web-browser environment. They are embedded into the [K2View Web Framework](/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.html).  

Fabric Reports application include the Designer and Viewer components:

* **Designer** enables creating the report template including the following: 
- Definition of data sources, data sets and parameters.
  - Creation of the report layout and binding to data set's elements.
  - Definition of the report properties including the layout design.
  - Access to Designer is available via the Studio since it is applicable during the project development only. 

* **Viewer** enables running the report preview including the following:
  * Run the report preview providing the parameters via prompt. 
  * Generate the reports and download the extract files.
  * Access to Designer is available via the Web Framework however the content (the reports 	list) is restricted based on the Fabric user role.

Reports can be generated by one of the following: 

* Manually by a user via the Reports Designer.
