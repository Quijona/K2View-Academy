# Reports Overview

Starting with V7.1, Fabric includes a **Reports** application which enables building interactive pixel-perfect reports. The application supports data binding to a wide variety of JSON data sources by providing flexible connection configuration at design time and rich API for advanced use cases.

Fabric Reports is implemented using *ActiveReportsJS* by GrapeCity, and is included in Fabric's license and installation package. No separate installation or configuration is required. Fabric Reports operates in a web-browser environment, embedded into the [K2View Web Framework](/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.html).  

Fabric Reports application include the Designer and Viewer components:

* **Designer** enables creating the report template including the following: 
  - Definition of data sources, data sets and parameters.
  - Binding the report's elements to the data set's fields.
  - Setting of the report properties to define the report layout design (fonts, colors, etc). 
* **Viewer** enables running the report preview including the following:
  - Generation of report preview. 
  - Search of data within the preview file.
  - Selection of the extract format and download of the extract files. The supported formats are: PDF, HTML and CSV.

Access to Designer is available via the Studio since it is required during the project development stage. Access to Viewer is available via the Web Framework application's list.

The reports can be generated by one of the following ways: 

* Via running a report in the Reports Viewer.
