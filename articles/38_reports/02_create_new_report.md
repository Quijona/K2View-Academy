# Report Creation

The reports creation is comprised of the following steps:

1. Define a data source and data set(s) in an empty report canvas. 
2. Validate the data set(s) and define the input parameter(s).
3. Create the data binding between the report elements and the data set's fields. 
4. Set the report's layout design (fonts, colors, etc.).

This article describes how to start a new report creation. The next articles of this user guide explain about the additional steps.

### New Report

To initiate a new report creation, go to the Logical Unit in the project tree, right-click on **Reports > New Report** and populate the report name. Click Enter to create and open an empty report canvas. 

Now, click anywhere on the gray area around the report layout to load the report properties in the **Properties Panel**. Here you can set various report level properties. For example, margins style.
