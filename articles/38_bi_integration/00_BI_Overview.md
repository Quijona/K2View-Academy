# BI Overview

Fabric provides a built-in integration with external Exago BI system that enables the creation and generation of reports. 

Exago BI can be accessed from the [K2View Web Framework](https://support.k2view.com/Academy_6.5/articles/30_web_framework/01_web_framework_overview.html) whereas two applications are included there:

* **BI Admin**, for the system configuration and initial setup. Only the users that have a BI Admin or BI Designer role can access this application.
* **BI Designer**, for the creation and generation of the reports. Any user can access this application however the access to various content elements (folders, reports, etc.) within this application can be restricted by setting up the permission rules. 

Prior to starting your work on the reports creation, perform the following setup steps:

* Installation and Storage Management setup.
* Access permissions settings.
* Metadata setup.

Each of these steps is described in details in the subsequent articles.
