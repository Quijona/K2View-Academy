# BI Implementation Steps 

Working with the BI requires the installation and several one-time setup activities performed in **BI Admin** module. Then you can work on the reports using the **BI Designer**. When the reports are created, tested and ready for execution, they can be invoked from the Fabric user code using a Fabric JOB framework. This can be done using a JOBTYPE = GENERATE_BI.

This user guide provides the process description how to setup the **BI** using the **BI Admin**:

* [Installation and Configuration](01_Installation.md).
* [Permissions setup](02_Permissions_Setup.md).
* [Metadata setup](03_Metadata_Setup).
* [Parameters definition](04_parameters.md).

Once the setup is complete, you can create your own reports. The [Exago Support Center](https://support.exagoinc.com/hc/en-us) provides full information how to do it.

The below links concise the important points to be considered when creating and running the reports over Fabric using the **BI Designer**:
