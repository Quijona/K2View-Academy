# Fabric BI Implementation Steps 

To implement **Fabric BI** you must first install it and perform other one-time steps using the **BI Admin** module. 

Once the installation is complete, you work with the **BI Designer** module. This module allows you to create and generate reports. When the reports are tested and ready for execution, they can be moved from a development into QA or Production environment.

This user guide provides the step-by-step description of how to set up **Fabric BI** using the **BI Admin** module:

* [Installation and Configuration](01_Installation.md).
* [Permissions setup](02_Permissions_Setup.md).
* [Metadata setup](03_Metadata_Setup).
* [Parameters definition](04_parameters.md).

Once the setup is complete, you can create reports. The links below summarize important points to take into consideration when creating and running the reports over Fabric using the **BI Designer**:

* [Reports creation guidelines](05_report_creation_guidelines.md).
* [Reports execution guidelines](06_report_execution_guidelines.md).

The procedures of moving from development to QA/PROD are described below:

* [Moving from DEV to QA/PROD](07_moving_from_dev_to_prod.md).

Since the Fabric BI is based on ExagoBI, more information on how to create, design, and generate reports can be found in the [Exago Support Center](https://exagobi.com/support/).
