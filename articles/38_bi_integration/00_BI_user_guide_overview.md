# BI Implementation Steps 

In order to work with the BI, it is required to perform the installation and several one-time setup activities using the **BI Admin** module. Then you can work on the reports using the **BI Designer** - create the reports and generate them via the **BI Designer**. The reports can also be invoked from the Fabric user code using a Fabric JOB framework. This can be done using a **GENERATE_BI** Job Type. When the reports are tested and ready for execution, they can be moved from a development into QA or Production environment.

This user guide provides the step-by-step description of how to setup the **BI** using the **BI Admin**:

* [Installation and Configuration](01_Installation.md).
* [Permissions setup](02_Permissions_Setup.md).
* [Metadata setup](03_Metadata_Setup).
* [Parameters definition](04_parameters.md).

Once the setup is complete, you can create the reports. The below links concise the important points to be considered when creating and running the reports over Fabric using the **BI Designer**:

* [Reports creation guidelines](05_report_creation_guidelines.md).
* [Reports execution guidelines](06_report_execution_guidelines.md).

The procedures of moving from development to QA/PROD are described below:

* [Moving from DEV to QA/PROD](07_moving_from_dev_to_prod.md).
