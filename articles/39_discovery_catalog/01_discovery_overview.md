# Data Discovery Overview

<web>

Today, nearly all companies are required to combine and integrate data from multiple sources, while collecting huge amounts of data on their customers, markets, suppliers, etc. Each day, more diverse sources and new data formats are added. Many of these data sources are either not well structured or do not have predefined relations. As a result, decision makers are drowning in data but starving for insights. On top of that, the risks relating to data security increase, causing companies to set this issue with high priority. 

Data Discovery is a process that can help companies to cope with the above-mentioned problems. Its purpose is to:

* Keep pace with the ongoing changes and adapt to them quickly.
* Uncover and investigate hidden yet potentially useful data insights.
* Find and flag sensitive information, enabling a better protection of it.

Fabric provides a Data Discovery solution that provides an insight into the Fabric interfaces, starting with the RDBMS interface type. The solution's capabilities are:

* Explore the data source's elements (schemas, objects, fields) and the links between them.
* Profile the metadata and the data (e.g. PII identification).
* Establish additional links between the data source elements - based on user-defined rules.
* Display the data catalog as a tree and allow to navigate within this tree.

The solution framework includes an infrastructure that executes various types of business rules, such as: establish the links between schema elements, profile the data, identify PII, and more. The baseline rules are included into the framework; definition of additional rules is allowed.
