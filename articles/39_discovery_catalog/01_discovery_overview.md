# Data Discovery Overview

<web>

Nowadays companies are required to combine and integrate data from multiple sources. Each day there are more data sources and new data formats. On top of that, data security's risk increases every day, thus it becomes every companyâ€™s high priority. 

Data Discovery is a process that can help companies to cope with the mentioned above problems. Its purpose is to:

* Keep up with the ongoing market changes and adapt quickly to them.
* Provide a complete view of organization's metadata and the data.
* Find and flag sensitive information, to be able to better protect it.

Starting with V7.1, Fabric provides a Data Discovery solution enabling complete view of the Fabric interfaces, starting from RDBMS interface type. The solution capabilities are:

* Explore the data source's elements (schemas, objects, fields) and the links between them.
* Profile the metadata and the data (e.g. PII identification).
* Establish additional links between the data source elements.
* Display the data catalog as a tree and allow to navigate within this tree.

The solution framework includes an infrastructure that executes various types of business rules, such as: establish the links between schema elements, profile the data based on predefined rules, identify PII, and more. The baseline rules are included into the framework and additional rules definition is allowed.
