# Catalog Versioning

The purpose of the Catalog versioning is to provide the tools to identify changes in the data source. Any kind of change is discoverable, for example, field adding/removal or a change in the property's value. 

A new version is created in the *neo4j* Graph DB when the Discovery process is executed and changes from the previous version are found.

Then, by using the Catalog application, the user can click the <img src="images/compare.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> icon to select a version to compare with the currently displayed version. 

The differences between the versions are indicated using colors:

* New elements or relations are colored in green.
* Removed elements or relations are colored in red.
* A updated Data Sets (e.g. new field) are colored in blue.
* An updated property is displayed twice â€“  the new property name or value is green, the removed is red.
* All unchanged entities and relations are colored in dark grey color (unlike the regular view where nodes are blue and links are orange).
