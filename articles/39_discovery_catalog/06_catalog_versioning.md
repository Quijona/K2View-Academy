# Catalog Versioning

The purpose of the Catalog versioning is to provide the tools to identify changes in the data source. Any kind of change is discoverable, for example, field adding/removal or a change in the property's value. 

A new version is created in the *neo4j* Graph DB when the Discovery process is executed and changes from the previous version are found.

Then, by using the Data Catalog application, the user can click the <img src="images/compare.png" style="zoom:80%;" /> icon to select a version to compare with the latest version. 

The differences between the versions are indicated using colors:

* New elements or relations are colored in green.
* Removed elements or relations are colored in red.
* When a property's value is updated, it is displayed twice â€“ the removed value in red and the new value in green.
* In the versioning view, all the unchanged relations are colored in black (unlike the regular view where the links are colored in orange).
