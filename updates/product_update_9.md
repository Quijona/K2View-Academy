* **SAML/Active Directory/LDAP** - Authentication support.
* **Query LUI Without GET ("No Get")** - Ability to query data from the Fabricâ€™s Logical Unit without performing an explicit GET command when AUTO_MDB_SCOPE = true and the query includes a WHERE clause with the filter by IID.
* In **iidFinder**, an ability to configure the Consumer Group ID via **iifConfig.ini** was added. In addition, some properties were removed.
* New Broadway Actors were added, such as **Unzip**, image manipulation and more. In addition, an existing **Email** Actor now supports HTML format and can send attachments.
