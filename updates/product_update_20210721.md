### Improved Search Experience

The Search experience of the K2View Support Platform has been improved by introducing the following:

* Search suggestions. Get the best match for your key word in the search widget as you type.
* Search is now performed not only on the Knowledge Base, but on the Q&A and Community as well. 
* Full search results are categorized as Knowledge Base, Q&A or Community, so you can filter the results by category.
