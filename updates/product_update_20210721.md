### Improved Search Experience

The Search experience of the K2View Support Platform has been improved by introducing the following:

* Search suggestions. Get the best match for your key word in the search widget as you type.
* Search results are retrieved from not only the Knowledge Base, but now from the Q&A and Community categories as well. 
* Search results are displayed indicating from where the results were retrieved: Knowledge Base, Q&A or Community. In addition, you can filter the results by category.
