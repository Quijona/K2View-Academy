### Improved Search Experience

The Search experience of the K2View Support Platform has been improved by introducing the following:

* Search suggestions. Get the best match for your key word in the search widget as you type.
* Search both the articles and the forum. You can now search within the Q&A too!
* Full search results. What to see all the results? Press enter in the search widget and get them all, broken by three categories: Knowledge Base, Q&A and Community. Note that you can filter the results by category.
