### The Fabric 6.5.5 Official Release

We have just released Fabric 6.5.5, which includes the following enhancements:

* **Data Explorer** - added an easier end-to-end view of the total sync time. There is now one view of all tables involved, which will help to identify performance bottlenecks.
* Common Java utilities were added to the **documentation** application.
* **Broadway** - when searching for Actors, the filtering option now has CamelCase as higher priority. 
* **Fabric BI** now supports integration with Elastic Search by using the Fabric search command.
