### The Fabric 6.5.8 Official Release

We have just released Fabric 6.5.8, which includes the following enhancements:

* **Fabric Views**  which are designed to keep a predefined query on LU tables in the Fabric MicroDB, allowing an easy access to a required data collection.
* **Field Level Authorization** is a mechanism that enables access restriction to sensitive data, based on the predefined role, by redirecting the call from querying the LU table to its corresponding LU view.
* **WS Auth&Auth - OAuth Support** for Fabric Web Services authorization.
* **Broadway** usability improvements, new actors have been introduced and existing actors enhanced. 
* **Additional Permissions** property on WS enables activating methods to be accessible by the WS which are restricted for a user who is running this WS (based on the user role definition).
* **Bug Fixes**
