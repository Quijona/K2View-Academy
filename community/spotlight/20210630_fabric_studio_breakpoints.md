### Fabric Studio Breakpoints

![](images/breakpoints_1.PNG)

Fabric Studio enables viewing of all active breakpoints. 

A new panel was added to the “Server / Activity Logs” area, displaying a list of the breakpoints in the open Fabric objects (currently only Broadway flows are supported), including the File name (flow name) and the ID (e.g. stage where the breakpoint is set).

When the panel is open (i.e. visible to the user), it is refreshed every 1 second. The yellow arrow sign on the panel indicates the breakpoint where the flow has currently stopped. A double-click on the breakpoint description in the panel carries the related flow to the front.
