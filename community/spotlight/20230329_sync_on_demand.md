# Sync On Demand

![](images/sync_on_demand_ex1.png)

The purpose of a Sync On Demand mode is to reduce the time spent by Fabric performing the LUI sync by synchronizing only the relevant data. 

In this mode, the sync is performed only on tables that are a part of the executed SELECT statement and their parent tables. 

The sync follows the standard Sync mechanism rules that are based on a LU predefined sync method and sync mode.
