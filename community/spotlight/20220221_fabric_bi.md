### The Fabric BI Solution

![](images/bi_1.PNG)

Fabric includes a business intelligence application, called **BI**, which is embedded into the Fabric Web Framework. The Fabric BI enables the design and execution of reports and dashboards, and can connect to various data sources in order to read the data: 

* PostgreSQL, Oracle, Fabric MicroDB and Common DB. 
* A combination of several data sources created with joints between them.

The Fabric BI application includes two modules:

* **Admin** - system configuration and initial setup module enabling the user to do the following:

  - Create data sources and define their metadata (objects and joins).

  - Create parameters for applying a filter within reports.

  - Update various system configurations (advanced).

- **Designer** - content creation module enabling the user to do the following:
  - Create various types of reports and dashboards.
  - Generate the reports / dashboards and download the extract files.

Access to Admin is restricted and it's based on the Fabric user role.

Reports can be generated by one of the following:

- Manually by the user via the BI Designer application.
- Using a deep link - predefined URL that includes the Fabric host, port, the report name and the parameters (if required).
- Using the STARTJOB command of the Fabric Job mechanism.

The BI User Guide provides a detailed description of steps to be taken in order to setup the BI application and develop the reports and dashboard.
