Broadway UI has undergone a major facelift, introducing a new up-to-date coloring scheme.

In addition, several new exciting features and actors have been added, some are described below.

#### Custom editors

Broadway now allows creating custom editors (plug-ins) on a project level. The implementation of your custom editor should be placed in a new folder under the Server/fabric/staticWeb/editors folder, in the index.html file. 

Using the [Actor Editor](https://support.k2view.com/Academy/articles/19_Broadway/28_actor_editor.html), the editor can then be used by any actor, attaching it to the actorâ€™s input argument.

#### Search enhancements

The Broadway Flow SEARCH was enhanced and now any object in a flow can be searched: stage, actor, parameter (input/output) or a schema element (in the yellow segment). 

The Search Results field indicates the number of occurrences found in a flow and allows to navigate between them using the Prev/Next buttons.
